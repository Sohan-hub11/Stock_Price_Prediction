# Stock_Price_Prediction
This project demonstrates how to use an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network to predict future stock prices based on historical data. The data is sourced from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance library.
🚀 Features
  Fetches historical stock price data using yfinance
  Data preprocessing and normalization
  Visualization of stock trends using Matplotlib
  LSTM model built with TensorFlow/Keras
  Predicts future closing prices
  Compares predicted prices vs actual prices
